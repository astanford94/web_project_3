              Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the
              shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind
              would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which case
              they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and
              the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are
              absolutely amazing.
            </p>
            <p class="places__paragraph">
              The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
              architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If
              you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is difficult
              to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The left
              bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though,
              even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.

              The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below from
              a rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been
              built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900 years
              later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia
              has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.

            <p class="places__paragraph">
              A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the
              world's best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is
              rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame is
              the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five years
              in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was
              also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold
              the office of Prime Minister of the UK.

              Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky. The
              town is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's
              known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and visitors
              will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with handmade
              jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more.
              The town holds a yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local
              dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

              However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea
              College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south
              to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be
              coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every
              student receives a full-tuition scholarship.

              Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom
              era, Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its
              cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World

              The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you
              would think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea
              level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the province.
              But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest plantations of
              tea and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's
              exports.

              The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for

              Park lies at the apex of the beautiful mountains of the Congo-Nile
              Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of altitude. It is
              filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various

              The San Francisco Bay Area, popularly referred to as the Bay Area,
              is a populous region surrounding the San Francisco, San Pablo, and
              Suisun Bay estuaries in Northern California. Although the exact
              boundaries of the region are variously defined, the Bay Area is
              defined by the Association of Bay Area Governments to include the
              nine counties that border the aforementioned estuaries: Alameda,
              Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma,
              and San Francisco. Other definitions may exclude parts of or even
              entire counties, or expand the boundaries to include neighboring
              counties that do not border the bay such as Santa Cruz and San
              Benito (more often included in the Central Coast regions); or San
              Joaquin, Merced, and Stanislaus (more often included in the
              Central Valley).

            <p class="places__paragraph">
              Home to approximately 7.75 million people, Northern California's
              nine-county Bay Area contains many cities, towns, airports, and
              associated regional, state, and national parks, connected by a
              complex multimodal transportation network. The larger federal
              classification, the combined statistical area of the region which
              includes fourteen counties, is the second-largest in California
              (after the Greater Los Angeles area), the fifth-largest in the
              United States, and the 41st-largest urban area in the world with
              9.67 million people. The Bay Area's population is ethnically
              diverse: roughly half of the region's residents are Hispanic,
              Asian, African American, or Pacific Islander, all of whom have a
              significant presence throughout the region.
